    "description": "I’m Federico Roma, former world champion in Muay Thai and Kickboxing. With over 20 years of experience, I trained at the Escuela de Campeones Dojo Serpiente and in training camps across Thailand. I’ve competed in countries such as Uruguay, Peru, Mexico, France, Poland, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nAs a coach, I’ve worked with both amateur and professional fighters, representing Argentina in international events like Glory Kickboxing, RISE (Japan), and WGP. I’ve trained champions across multiple disciplines, and I also offer personalized classes, where I teach the art with the same passion — helping my students reach goals like weight loss, improved technique, and greater confidence.",
