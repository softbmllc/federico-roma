    "title": "About Me",
    "description": "I’m Federico Roma, former world champion in Muay Thai and Kickboxing. With over 20 years of experience, I trained at the Escuela de Campeones Dojo Serpiente and in training camps across Thailand. I’ve competed in countries such as Uruguay, Peru, Mexico, France, Poland, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nAs a coach, I’ve worked with both amateur and professional fighters, representing Argentina in international events like Glory Kickboxing, RISE (Japan), and WGP. I’ve trained champions across multiple disciplines, and I also offer personalized classes, where I teach the art with the same passion — helping my students reach goals like weight loss, improved technique, and greater confidence.",

    "earlySteps": {
      "title": "My early steps in sports",
      "p1": "I was always very athletic. I was always doing something: running, jumping, playing. At 5 years old, I started playing tennis. I couldn’t even get the ball over the net and dragged my racket around, but I wanted to hit every ball. What started casually ended up lasting 10 years.",
      "p2": "One day, while I was training, I stepped on a ball I didn’t see. I fell backwards and landed all my weight on one leg. I fractured my tibia. It was a serious fracture, and I spent six months in a cast. But the next day, I still went to train in a wheelchair, cast and all. The coaches were incredibly patient with me."

    "infancyDiscipline": {
      "title": "My childhood: discipline, movies and martial arts",
      "p1": "At 13 I started Karate, and between 15 and 16 I did a bit of Aikido. At that time, I was very immersed in traditional martial arts. At 18 I started boxing, and within a few months I was hooked on kickboxing.",
      "p2": "My parents always emphasized the academic path. I was studying Computer Engineering, and they thought that was my destiny. I was always good with computers, I liked it. But the passion I felt while training was something else.",
      "p3": "Since I was a kid I’ve been a fan of martial arts movies. I watched them all: Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Bruce Lee… I used to binge-watch them on Sundays at noon."

    "firstFight": {
      "title": "My first fight, my first fire",
      "p1": "My first fight was a mix of emotions: anxiety, nerves, adrenaline. I was warming up and Christian showed me my opponent. He took out a black belt from his bag. I looked at it and it said: '4th Dan Karate'. I was a green belt in kickboxing.",
      "p2": "I thought: this guy is dangerous. He had tremendous kicks. If he landed one clean, who knows what would’ve happened. It was a tough fight. But I managed to win on points. When it ended, I said to myself: I want more of this.",
      "p3": "I felt something amazing in the progress. Every day something improved: my punches, my kicks, my movement. My teammates also helped me, gave me tips. I was always good at listening and applying.",
      "p4": "I had just a few amateur fights when Cristian proposed a match in Uruguay. It was going to be my first professional fight."

    "lossAndStrength": {
      "title": "The pain that pushed me to become stronger",
      "p1": "One of the hardest moments in my life was when my father passed away. I had been competing for a few years, and he passed from pancreatic cancer. It was a huge blow. That’s when I had to choose: let myself fall, or transform that pain.",
      "p2": "I gathered strength. My dad always taught me to move forward. Giving up was not an option.",
      "p3": "Since then, I always travel with two amulets: one photo of him and one of my grandfather, my Nono. They’re always with me. They give me strength, they protect me.",
      "p4": "For me, WKN was the ultimate goal. I followed the rankings online, looked at all the world and European champions. I dreamed of being there someday, even if it felt far away."

    "dojoToWorld": {
      "title": "From Dojo Serpiente to the world's biggest stages",
      "p1": "After much effort, training and fights, I got the opportunity: a tough fight against Tomas Tadlanek, the European champion. It was for the WKN Intercontinental Muay Thai title.",
      "p2": "I wasn’t the favorite. But I trained like never before. I focused, I prepared, I gave it my all.",
      "p3": "I won by KO in the 4th round. It was a victory I will never forget.",
      "p4": "Thanks to that victory, I got the opportunity to fight for the world title against Tomasz Makowski. He was already a well-known name: 9-time world champion and had beaten all the top fighters. For me, it was a huge chance to fulfill a dream — being in the WKN rankings.",
      "p5": "The trip was long, with countless layovers. We left from Buenos Aires and finally arrived at the final destination in Poland after many hours of travel.",
      "p6": "Tomaz was clearly the favorite. But I wanted that belt. I wanted to win and become a world champion. Cristian always believed in me. Together, we developed a perfect strategy.",
      "p7": "Cristian told me: 'Throw four hard low kicks, then start letting loose.' I couldn’t take big risks at the start. I came out to pressure him and slowly wear him down. By the third round, Tomaz started to feel my power. I broke him down little by little.",
      "p8": "In the fourth round, he went down… and couldn’t get up. I WAS WORLD CHAMPION! That title changed everything for me. It was something incredibly powerful to win. I had never felt anything like it in my life — one of the most intense emotions I’ve ever experienced.",
      "p9": "That title changed everything for me. Winning it was incredibly powerful. I had never felt anything like it in my life — one of the most intense emotions I’ve ever experienced."
