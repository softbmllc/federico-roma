    "description": "I’m Federico Roma, former world champion in Muay Thai and Kickboxing. With over 20 years of experience, I trained at the Escuela de Campeones Dojo Serpiente and in training camps across Thailand. I’ve competed in countries such as Uruguay, Peru, Mexico, France, Poland, Japan, Thailand, and Indonesia.\n\nAs a coach, I’ve worked with both amateur and professional fighters, representing Argentina in international events like Glory Kickboxing, RISE (Japan), and WGP. I’ve trained champions across multiple disciplines, and I also offer personalized classes, where I teach the art with the same passion — helping my students reach goals like weight loss, improved technique, and greater confidence.",

    "earlySteps": {
      "title": "My early steps in sports",
      "p1": "I was always very athletic. I was always doing something: running, jumping, playing. At 5 years old, I started playing tennis. I couldn’t even get the ball over the net and dragged my racket around, but I wanted to hit every ball. What started casually ended up lasting 10 years.",
      "p2": "One day, while I was training, I stepped on a ball I didn’t see. I fell backwards and landed all my weight on one leg. I fractured my tibia. It was a serious fracture, and I spent six months in a cast. But the next day, I still went to train in a wheelchair, cast and all. The coaches were incredibly patient with me."

    "infancyDiscipline": {
      "title": "My childhood: discipline, movies and martial arts",
      "p1": "At 13 I started Karate, and between 15 and 16 I did a bit of Aikido. At that time, I was very immersed in traditional martial arts. At 18 I started boxing, and within a few months I was hooked on kickboxing.",
      "p2": "My parents always emphasized the academic path. I was studying Computer Engineering, and they thought that was my destiny. I was always good with computers, I liked it. But the passion I felt while training was something else.",
      "p3": "Since I was a kid I’ve been a fan of martial arts movies. I watched them all: Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Bruce Lee… I used to binge-watch them on Sundays at noon."

    "christianBosch": {
      "title": "Cristian Bosch and the dojo that shaped my journey",
      "p1": "I still remember the old dojo at Club Argentina in Castelar. I think it was around 2005 or 2006 when I started training with Cristian Bosch. I wanted to improve and never missed a class. I saw him as a great role model.",
      "p2": "Before every class I would start stretching at home, doing sit-ups. I arrived early. And once they allowed me, I would stay kicking the bags after training."
    },
    "firstFight": {
      "title": "My first fight, my first fire",
      "p1": "My first fight was a mix of emotions: anxiety, nerves, adrenaline. I was warming up and Christian showed me my opponent. He took out a black belt from his bag. I looked at it and it said: '4th Dan Karate'. I was a green belt in kickboxing.",
      "p2": "I thought: this guy is dangerous. He had tremendous kicks. If he landed one clean, who knows what would’ve happened. It was a tough fight. But I managed to win on points. When it ended, I said to myself: I want more of this.",
      "p3": "I felt something amazing in the progress. Every day something improved: my punches, my kicks, my movement. My teammates also helped me, gave me tips. I was always good at listening and applying.",
      "p4": "I had just a few amateur fights when Cristian proposed a match in Uruguay. It was going to be my first professional fight."

    "lossAndStrength": {
      "title": "The pain that pushed me to become stronger",
      "p1": "One of the hardest moments in my life was when my father passed away. I had been competing for a few years, and he passed from pancreatic cancer. It was a huge blow. That’s when I had to choose: let myself fall, or transform that pain.",
      "p2": "I gathered strength. My dad always taught me to move forward. Giving up was not an option.",
      "p3": "Since then, I always travel with two amulets: one photo of him and one of my grandfather, my Nono. They’re always with me. They give me strength, they protect me.",
      "p4": "For me, WKN was the ultimate goal. I followed the rankings online, looked at all the world and European champions. I dreamed of being there someday, even if it felt far away."
    },
    "dojoToWorld": {
      "title": "From Dojo Serpiente to the world's biggest stages",
      "p0": "For me, WKN was the ultimate. I followed all the rankings online, watched the world and European champions. I dreamed of being there someday, even if it felt far away.",
      "p1": "After a lot of effort, training, and fights, I got the opportunity: a very tough match against Tomas Tadlanek, European champion. It was for the WKN Intercontinental Muay Thai title.",
      "p2": "I wasn’t the favorite. But I trained like never before. I focused, I prepared, and gave it my all.",
      "p3": "I won by KO in the 4th round. It was a victory I’ll never forget.",
      "p4": "Thanks to that victory, I got the chance to fight for the world title against Tomasz Makowski. He was already a huge name — 9-time world champion, and had beaten all the best. For me, it was a massive opportunity to fulfill a dream: to be ranked by the WKN.",
      "p5": "The trip was incredibly long, with countless layovers. We left Buenos Aires and only arrived at the final destination in Poland after many, many hours.",
      "p6": "Tomaz was the clear favorite. But I wanted that belt. I wanted to win and be a world champion. I knew it was going to be a brutal fight. Cristian always believed in me. Together, we crafted a strategy — and everything went perfectly.",
      "p7": "Cristian told me: “Throw four strong low kicks and then start letting go.” I couldn’t take big risks at the beginning. I stepped forward, wore him down little by little. By the third round, he started feeling my punches. I slowly broke him down.",
      "p8": "In the fourth round, he fell… and couldn’t get back up.\n\nI WAS WORLD CHAMPION!",
      "p9": "That title meant so much to me. Winning it was incredibly powerful. I had never felt anything like it. It was one of the most intense emotions of my life."

      "p2": "I offer personalized classes for all types of people, from those who want to deeply study the art, to those who want to improve their fitness, lose weight, or simply train with purpose.",
      "p3": "I’m an ontological coach, boxing coach and personal trainer. This allows me to guide physical transformation processes with a holistic approach: technical, physical and mental.",

I'm from Salto, a small town in the province of Buenos Aires, where opportunities aren’t always the same. But he supported us and shared his knowledge so we could train and be part of his team. Today, I’m a kickboxing instructor, graduated from one of the top martial arts academies — Dojo Serpiente. A dream come true. That’s why, to honor everything he’s done and continues to do for us, our school is named after him: 'Esc. Federico Roma'. Today, it has over 60 students, many of whom are already competing at a very good level. Thank you, Fede! We keep progressing thanks to his guidance — even from a distance, he’s always communicating and offering advice for every situation and training. A great person with strong values and a true role model!"
